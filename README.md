Thesis-Code
===========

These are the codes that I am using for my MS in Geography Thesis project.  I like 
the idea of making science open and reproducable, so I'm putting my codes up for the world
to see.  I haven't yet decided what I will do with my data as of 2014-08-20.

The .R files are R scripts, and should make mention of what version they were written on.
The .sh files are Bash scripts that were written on Ubuntu 14.04
The .py files are Python scripts that should make mention of what version they were written on.
